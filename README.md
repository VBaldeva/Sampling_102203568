# Sampling

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of various sampling techniques to address class imbalance in credit card fraud detection. It evaluates the performance of different machine learning models trained on resampled datasets.

## Steps

1. Load the Dataset
2. Split the Dataset
3. Define Sampling Techniques
4. Define Machine Learning Models
5. Train and Evaluate Models
6. Display Results

## Results DataFrame

The results table provides a clear comparison of model performance across different sampling techniques, helping in selecting the best combination for fraud detection.


Overall this repository represents how to execute different sampling techinques while it also contains the results assciated with it in [Output Image](./Output_102203568.png) . And the code for the same is in [Smpling_102203568](Sampling_102203568.ipynb).
